Appendices
Appendix A: Glossary
At Risk: Delivery status indicating potential for late arrival based on current progress and traffic conditions.
Buffer Time: Additional time allowance (default 30 minutes) added to travel time calculations to account for loading, traffic, and other delays.
ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival): Calculated time when vehicle is expected to reach destination based on current location, route, and traffic conditions.
Fleet Manager: Primary user responsible for overall fleet operations, performance monitoring, and strategic decision-making.
Geocoding: Process of converting street addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).
Idle Status: Vehicle state indicating minimal movement (1-5 mph), typically during loading/unloading operations.
Late Status: Delivery status indicating appointment time has already passed.
Load Number: Unique identifier assigned to delivery shipments for tracking and reference purposes.
Moving Status: Vehicle state indicating active travel (speed > 5 mph).
Natural Language Input: User interface feature allowing appointment entry in conversational format rather than structured forms.
On Time Status: Delivery status indicating sufficient time to reach destination before appointment.
Risk Assessment: Algorithmic analysis of delivery completion probability based on current vehicle position, destination, and appointment timing.
Stationary Status: Vehicle state indicating no movement (speed = 0) for extended period (5+ minutes).
